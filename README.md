# IoT Camera Project 

Initial Commit.  The repository contains the following components:

* Arduino Skecth project: the sketch implements code to enable multiple sensors (sound, environment and proximity). Based on distance, noise or light intensity we can trigger the cam anytime. 
* Python code: Upload the image taken by the photograph to server via FTP.

## Last but not least ... 

Big thanks to Arduino Board and Base Shield with modular electronic components for making this possible
